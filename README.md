## Which Line Should I Stand in at the Store?
This program cooperates with a small discreetly placed camera to measure the speed of the cashiers and self-checkout machines. Upon getting ready for checkout, the program scans the current state of customers in line for quanity of groceries and makes a recommendation for which line (fastest, slowest, chattiest) to enter for checkout.
